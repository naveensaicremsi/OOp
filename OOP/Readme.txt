OOP in C++ 
==========
OOP- OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming

OOP is a programming paradigm . It is a set of rules , ideas and concepts . It is a standard way to solve any specific problem.

The idea of Object Oriented paradigm is to represent the real world objects , real world entities , real world attributes and their behavior. 

To explain the real world object to our computer and to express in our program.

The Four traits of Object Oriented Programming are

1. Encapsulation

2. Abstraction

3. Inheritance

4. Polymorphism


1.Encapsulation  (Access Specifiers such as public , private, protected)

Binding together the data and the methods that are associated with it so that no one from outside the class can access directly.

2.Abstraction

Hiding the complex things in the procedure so that it looks simple.

3.Inheritance

There will be a base class which is also called as a parent class and there will be a child class which is also called as a child class.
The child class contains the properties of the parent class as well as the properties that are defined in that particular class.

4.Polymorphism 

poly means many

morph means forms

Polymorphism means the Object and the methods that are associated with it can have many forms.

One of the most widely used in Polymorphism is 

The base class reference can be used to refer a object of child class. Suppose let the base class be Employee and the derived class be Developer.
Employee *e1;
Developer d1;
el=&d1; // Here the pointer of type employee is referring to the object of the Developer named d1.
